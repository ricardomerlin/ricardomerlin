### A light intro to my background:

Up until a few months ago, I had dreams of attending veterinary school and becoming a bridge between low income pet owners and high quality veterinary care. However, years of temptation at a career in tech finally caught up with me and led to my decision to apply to Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp.

### Some Career Goals:

‚è≥ Short-term Goal: I aim to deepen my tech skills across software development and programming focusing on projects that sharpen my expertise and reveal my passions. Alongside, I'll pursue relevant certifications to enhance my versatility in tech roles.

üå± Long-term Goal: My vision is to merge my software development and AI knowledge with veterinary medicine, creating AI-driven tools to revolutionize animal care. By advancing my education in AI and collaborating on pioneering projects, I aspire to lead efforts in developing technologies that elevate veterinary practices and animal welfare worldwide.

### Projects that I'm currently working on:

üñ•Ô∏è TheSocialNetwork: A social media application that is a Facebook dupe of sorts. I haven't yet worked with direct messaging so I'm excited to understand the methods required for this. When the base is all set up, I want to find a way to implement a higher level of user authentication - perhaps face id or audio recognition - into my application.

üìã JobJotter: A program for tracking the job application process. There are apps that already do this, just figured it would be an interesting project to work on!
