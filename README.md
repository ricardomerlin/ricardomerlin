### I'm Ricardo, glad you've ventured to my github page :).

### A light intro to my background

### Currently, I'm working on a social media application that is a Facebook dupe of sorts. I have'nt yet worked with direct messaging so I'm excited to understand the methods required for this. When the base is all set up, I want to find a way to implement a higher level of user authentication - perhaps face id or audio recognition - into my application.
